      <p>
        Rise my brothers we are blessed by steel In my sword I trust Arm
        yourselves the truth shall be revealed In my sword I trust Tyrants and
        cowards for metal you will kneel In my sword I trust Till justice and
        reason we'll wield In my sword I trust In my sword I trust

      <h1>Othe</h1>
      <p>
        On the blood of our fathers, on the blood of our kin, I swore to uphold
        my mantle to The Elite Force. Beyond the day my bones shall become nil
        but ash and dust, I shall protect those who are the innocent and
        unarmed. I am a guard of honor, I am a guard for recognition, I am a
        guard for the bloodline, and the people that it holds, and I will hold
        The Great Emperor and the royal bloodline over everything I hold most
        dear. I am and always will be The Elite Force [your name]. My bones are
        beyond dust and my soul is on fire. I will uphold the integrity of my
        burden among the wicked of our family. I will hold all the harshest of
        decisions made as a mask to make our clan stand stronger throughout all
        fields of battle. If it is writing I will excel, if it is racing I will
        outrun, If it is shooting, I promise my bullets will go straight. If it
        is my e,-leiâ€™, I will never fall, for it is part of my arm. If my
        Emperor is threatened, I will stand in the way, as he has no right to be
        told what to do by the weak. If he is fired upon, it is my duty to stand
        in the the way; as it is my duty to defend the royal bloodline and The
        Great Emperor. If his children or kin are threatened, it is my place to
        defend them, as they will be the ones to carry our world forward. I
        swear to the family. I swear to the sword. I swear to The Great Emperor.
        I will always listen to my officers. They are the ones that will lead me
        to grace and honor, and the great force will stand by me. If I, [insert
        name], break this, I will leave the family, to not hold the family back.
